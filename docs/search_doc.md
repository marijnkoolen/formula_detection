## `transform_candidate_to_list` function:
- **Purpose:** Converts a candidate (either a string or a list of strings) into a list of strings. If the input is a string, it splits it by spaces; if it's already a list of strings, it returns the list as is.
- **Input:**
  - `candidate` (Union[str, List[str]]): The candidate input, which can be either a string or a list of strings.
- **Output:**
  - (List[str]): A list of strings, either split from the input string or directly returned if the input is already a list of strings.
- **Raises:**
  - `TypeError`: If the input is neither a string nor a list of strings.

## `transform_candidate_to_string` function:
- **Purpose:** Converts a candidate (either a string or a list of strings) into a single string. If the input is a list of strings, it joins them with spaces; if it's already a string, it returns the string as is.
- **Input:**
  - `candidate` (Union[str, List[str]]): The candidate input, which can be either a string or a list of strings.
- **Output:**
  - (str): A string, either joined from the input list of strings or returned directly if the input is already a string.
- **Raises:**
  - `TypeError`: If the input is neither a string nor a list of strings.

## `transform_candidates_to_lists` function:
- **Purpose:** Converts a list of candidates (each of which can be a string or a list of strings) into a list of lists of strings. Each candidate is processed using `transform_candidate_to_list`.
- **Input:**
  - `candidates` (List[Union[str, List[str]]]): A list of candidates, where each candidate can be either a string or a list of strings.
- **Output:**
  - (List[List[str]]): A list of lists of strings, where each candidate has been transformed into a list of strings.
  
## `transform_candidates_to_strings` function:
- **Purpose:** Converts a list of candidates (each of which can be a string or a list of strings) into a list of strings. Each candidate is processed using `transform_candidate_to_string`.
- **Input:**
  - `candidates` (List[Union[str, List[str]]]): A list of candidates, where each candidate can be either a string or a list of strings.
- **Output:**
  - (List[str]): A list of strings, where each candidate has been transformed into a string.

## `CandidatePhrase` class:
- **Purpose:** Represents a candidate phrase that can be either a single string or a list of strings. 
- **Methods:**
  - Transforms the phrase into both string and list formats.
  - Provides a string representation of the object for debugging.
  - Supports length calculation (the number of terms in the phrase list).

## `get_variable_terms_from_match` function:
- **Purpose:** Extracts terms from a document that correspond to the `<VAR>` placeholders in a given `CandidatePhrase`.
- **Input:**
  - `candidate_phrase` (CandidatePhrase): The candidate phrase containing variable placeholders.
  - `variable_match` (List[str]): The list of terms from the document that match the placeholders.
- **Output:** Returns a list of terms that match the `<VAR>` placeholders in the candidate phrase.

## `CandidatePhraseMatch` class:
- **Purpose:** Represents a match of a candidate phrase within a document, capturing various details about the match such as the start and end positions in both character and word indices.
- **Methods:**
  - Initializes a match object with details about the candidate phrase, its position in the document, and any matched variable terms.
  - Provides the length of the matched phrase (in characters).
  - A string representation for debugging and display.

## `make_candidate_phrase` function:
- **Purpose:** Converts a string or list of strings into a `CandidatePhrase` object, ensuring that placeholder variables (represented as `<VAR>`) are correctly handled.
- **Input:** A phrase (string or list of strings) to convert into a `CandidatePhrase`.
- **Output:** A `CandidatePhrase` object representing the input phrase.

## `extract_sub_phrases_with_skips` function:
- **Purpose:** Extracts sub-phrases from a given phrase, allowing for a specified number of skipped terms between n-gram components.
- **Use Case:** This function is useful for generating variations of a phrase with gaps, such as when dealing with flexible phrase matching in NLP tasks.
- **Input:**
  - `phrase` (List[str]): The phrase from which to extract sub-phrases.
  - `ngram_size` (int): The desired size of each n-gram.
  - `max_skips` (int): The maximum number of terms that can be skipped between n-gram components.
- **Output:** Yields each sub-phrase as a list of strings (terms) representing an n-gram with skips.

## `extract_sub_phrases` function:
- **Purpose:** Extracts all possible sub-phrases from a given phrase, with a maximum length for each sub-phrase.
- **Use Case:** Useful for generating all possible n-grams of a phrase, up to a specified maximum length.
- **Input:**
  - `phrase` (List[str]): The phrase from which to extract sub-phrases.
  - `max_length` (int, optional): The maximum length of each sub-phrase (default is 5).
- **Output:** A list of sub-phrases, each represented as a list of strings.

## `make_candidate_phrase_match` function:
- **Purpose:** Creates a `CandidatePhraseMatch` object by matching a candidate phrase in a document.
- **Input:**
  - `phrase` (Union[str, List[str]]): The candidate phrase to match.
  - `phrase_start` (int): The starting index of the phrase in the document.
  - `doc` (Doc): The document in which the phrase is being matched.
- **Output:** Returns a `CandidatePhraseMatch` object representing the match of the phrase in the document.
